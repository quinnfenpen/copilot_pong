# copilot_pong
This is a simple game of pong made using GitHub Copilot, creating a machine-learning bot for player 2.
At the moment it's not finished and broken, so I've turned it into a repo to let others try and fix it.
Have fun, add random things, upgrade the code, 
Change the paddle and/or ball to different objects (bonus points if someone makes things change randomly while playing it).
